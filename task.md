Task Overview ���ask
This task simulates a simple shopping cart system using various Redis data structures. It allows users to add, remove, and view items in their cart.
Project Structure 📁
markdown
shopping_cart/
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
└── utils/
    ├── redis_client.py

requirements.txt: Specifies Python libraries required for the project, including redis for interacting with Redis.
main.py: Main script for implementing shopping cart functionalities.
utils/: Directory for utility functions.
redis_client.py: Handles connecting to the Redis server and provides methods for interacting with different data structures.
Functionality 🛍️
User can add items to the cart (product name, quantity).
User can remove items from the cart.
User can view all items in the cart (including quantity).
Data Structures 📊
Products (Hash): Use a Redis Hash to store product information (product_id, name, price).
Cart (Sorted Set): Use a Redis Sorted Set to store items in the user's cart.
Additional Considerations 🔧
Implement error handling for potential issues like connection failures or invalid user input.
Consider adding functionality to set expiration times for cart items to simulate a session timeout.
Explore using Redis Pub/Sub for broadcasting cart updates across multiple clients (optional).
Structure of Functions 🔄
redis_client.py
python
import redis

def connect(host, port):
  # Function to connect to Redis server

def get_product(client, product_id):
  # Function to retrieve product details from Hash

def add_to_cart(client, product_id, quantity):
  # Function to add product to cart (Sorted Set)

def remove_from_cart(client, product_id):
  # Function to remove product from cart (Sorted Set)

def get_cart_items(client):
  # Function to retrieve all items (product_id, quantity) from cart (Sorted Set)

main.py
python
from utils.redis_client import connect, add_to_cart, remove_from_cart, get_cart_items

# Function to display main menu and get user choice

# Functions to handle adding, removing, and viewing cart items (call corresponding redis_client functions)

This structure provides a clear outline for each function's purpose. Remember to fill in the details using the appropriate Redis commands within each function to achieve the desired functionality. 😊
