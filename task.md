**Task: Shopping Cart with Redis Data Structures 🛍️**
=====================================================

This task simulates a simple shopping cart system using various Redis data structures. It allows users to add, remove, and view items in their cart. 🛍️

**Project Structure:**
--------------------

```
shopping_cart/
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
└── utils/
    ├── redis_client.py
```

* `requirements.txt`: This file will specify the Python libraries required for the project, including redis for interacting with Redis. 📚
* `main.py`: This is the main script where you'll implement the shopping cart functionalities. 📝
* `utils/`: This directory will contain utility functions. 🛠️
* `redis_client.py`: This file will handle connecting to the Redis server and provide methods for interacting with different data structures. 📈

**Functionality:**
----------------

* User can add items to the cart (product name, quantity). ➕
* User can remove items from the cart. ➖
* User can view all items in the cart (including quantity). 👀
* Implement functionality to handle situations where a user tries to add a non-existent product or removes an item that's not in the cart. 🚨

**Data Structures:**
-------------------

* **Products (Hash)**: Use a Redis Hash to store product information (e.g., product_id, name, price). The product_id will be the key, and the hash will contain details like name and price. 📊
* **Cart (Sorted Set)**: Use a Redis Sorted Set to store items in the user's cart. The member (product_id) will be the key, and the score will represent the quantity of that product. This allows easy retrieval of items and their quantities based on the score. 📈

**Additional Considerations:**
---------------------------

* Implement error handling for potential issues like connection failures or invalid user input. 🚨
* Consider adding functionality to set expiration times for cart items to simulate a session timeout. ⏰
* Explore using Redis Pub/Sub for broadcasting cart updates across multiple clients (optional). 📢

**Function Structure:**
----------------------

Here's the structure of the functions you'll need, without any actual code:

**redis_client.py**
```python
import redis

def connect(host, port):
  # Function to connect to Redis server

def get_product(client, product_id):
  # Function to retrieve product details from Hash

def add_to_cart(client, product_id, quantity):
  # Function to add product to cart (Sorted Set)

def remove_from_cart(client, product_id):
  # Function to remove product from cart (Sorted Set)

def get_cart_items(client):
  # Function to retrieve all items (product_id, quantity) from cart (Sorted Set)
```

**main.py (outline)**
```python
from utils.redis_client import connect, add_to_cart, remove_from_cart, get_cart_items

# Function to display main menu and get user choice

# Functions to handle adding, removing, and viewing cart items (call corresponding redis_client functions)
```

This structure provides a clear outline for each function's purpose. Remember to fill in the details using the appropriate Redis commands within each function to achieve the desired functionality. 💻
