üõçÔ∏è Shopping Cart with Redis Data Structures üõçÔ∏è
=====================================================

**Project Overview**
--------------------

This project simulates a simple shopping cart system using various Redis data structures. It allows users to add, remove, and view items in their cart.

**Project Structure**
---------------------

* `requirements.txt`: Specifies the Python libraries required for the project, including Redis.
* `main.py`: The main script where you'll implement the shopping cart functionalities.
* `utils/`: Directory containing utility functions.
	+ `redis_client.py`: Handles connecting to the Redis server and provides methods for interacting with different data structures.

**Functionality**
----------------

* Users can add items to the cart (product name, quantity).
* Users can remove items from the cart.
* Users can view all items in the cart (including quantity).
* Handles situations where a user tries to add a non-existent product or removes an item that's not in the cart.

**Data Structures**
-------------------

* **Products (Hash)**: Stores product information (e.g., product_id, name, price) using a Redis Hash.
* **Cart (Sorted Set)**: Stores items in the user's cart using a Redis Sorted Set, allowing easy retrieval of items and their quantities based on the score.

**Additional Considerations**
-----------------------------

* Implements error handling for potential issues like connection failures or invalid user input.
* Considers adding functionality to set expiration times for cart items to simulate a session timeout.
* Explores using Redis Pub/Sub for broadcasting cart updates across multiple clients (optional).

**Getting Started**
-------------------

1. Install the required Python libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `main.py` to start the shopping cart system.
3. Interact with the system using the provided functionality.
